Enhanced service worker caching policies\n2. Browser storage for conversion history/results\n3. Static asset optimization headers\n4. Cache management utilities\n5. Offline support indicators\n\nImplementation has begun with enhanced service worker and browser caching strategies.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T06:34:45.651Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-24T06:41:05.693Z>\n## Implementation Complete: Caching Strategies\n\n**Enhanced Service Worker (public/sw.js):**\n- Implemented cache-first and network-first patterns\n- Created multiple cache types: static assets, runtime, conversions\n- Added cache expiration with timestamp headers and TTL management\n- Set up automatic cache cleanup every 30 minutes\n- Integrated background sync for offline conversions\n- Developed message handling for cache management commands\n\n**Cache Manager System (src/lib/cacheManager.ts):**\n- Built comprehensive browser storage management (localStorage/sessionStorage)\n- Created memory cache for runtime performance\n- Implemented conversion history tracking\n- Added user preferences storage\n- Integrated performance metrics recording\n- Developed cache statistics and maintenance utilities\n- Set up automatic expired cache cleanup\n\n**Offline Indicator Component (src/components/OfflineIndicator.tsx):**\n- Added real-time network status monitoring\n- Implemented cache statistics display\n- Created manual cache cleanup controls\n- Integrated with service worker for background sync\n- Added development mode cache debugging tools\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- FileUploader now tracks performance metrics\n- Layout includes OfflineIndicator component\n- Enhanced service worker registration with sync capabilities\n\n**Performance Benefits:**\n- Static assets cached for 7 days\n- Dynamic content cached for 1 hour\n- API responses cached for 5 minutes\n- Conversion results cached for 24 hours\n- Memory cache for immediate access\n- Offline support for core functionality\n\nAll caching strategies are working together successfully, providing optimal performance and offline capabilities. Minor linter warnings remain but core functionality is complete and tested.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T06:41:05.693Z>",

The CDN URL appears to be incorrect or the specific version isn't available. Action required: Update the PDF.js worker URL to reference a reliable and available source to resolve the conversion issues.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T09:56:32.444Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-23T09:57:59.312Z>\nFixed the PDF.js worker loading issue by implementing a more robust configuration:\n\n1. Updated the primary worker URL to use unpkg.com: https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@4.10.38/build/pdf.worker.min.js\n2. Added fallback URLs for jsdelivr and cdnjs to ensure reliability\n3.

Added a local worker fallback by bundling the PDF.js worker file directly in the project assets\n2. Modified the worker loading logic to:\n   - First attempt to load from local assets\n   - If local loading fails, try the CDN URLs in sequence\n   - As last resort, set workerSrc to null which disables worker functionality but allows basic PDF parsing to continue\n\nThis approach ensures the application works in both development and production environments without CORS issues while maintaining optimal performance when possible.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T10:00:48.626Z>",

Add configuration options for table detection sensitivity:\n   ```typescript\n   interface TableDetectionOptions {\n     minRows: number;           // Minimum number of rows to consider as table\n     minCols: number;           // Minimum number of columns to consider as table\n     borderDetectionThreshold: number;  // Sensitivity for border detection\n     cellSpacingTolerance: number;      // Tolerance for cell spacing variations\n   }\n   ```\n\n8.

Implement a single professional-quality default configuration:\n\n```typescript\nexport const DEFAULT_CONVERSION_OPTIONS: ConversionOptions = {\n  imageOptions: {\n    extract: true,\n    maxSize: 1200,\n    quality: 95,\n    preserveAspectRatio: true\n  },\n  tableOptions: {\n    detect: true,\n    preserveFormatting: true,\n    maxComplexity: 100\n  },\n  formattingOptions: {\n    preserveStyles: true,\n    preserveFonts: true,\n    preserveColors: true,\n    preserveSpacing: true\n  }\n};\n```\n\n3. Simplify the main conversion function to use the professional settings by default:\n\n```typescript\nexport async function convertPdfToDocx(\n  file: File,\n  options: Partial<ConversionOptions> = {}\n): Promise<Blob> {\n  // Merge provided options with professional defaults\n  const mergedOptions = {\n    ...DEFAULT_CONVERSION_OPTIONS,\n    ...options\n  };\n  \n  // Pass the merged options to the PDF parser and DOCX generator\n  const pdfContent = await parsePdf(file, mergedOptions);\n  return generateDocx(pdfContent, mergedOptions);\n}\n```\n\n4. Update the UI components to reflect the professional-only approach:\n   - Remove mode selection controls\n   - Add a professional quality notice indicating users are getting the best conversion quality\n   - Retain advanced settings panel for power users who need specific customizations\n   - Update tooltips to explain the high-quality conversion features\n\n5. Update documentation to explain the professional-quality conversion approach:\n   - Emphasize that all users receive the highest quality conversion with all features enabled\n   - Explain the benefits of professional conversion (high-quality images, preserved tables, complete formatting)\n   - Document any performance considerations for large or complex documents",
        "testStrategy": "1. Create unit tests for the conversion options interface and defaults:\n   - Verify that the default settings match the professional quality configuration\n   - Test merging custom options with defaults\n   - Ensure type safety for all configuration parameters\n\n2. Implement integration tests for the conversion function:\n   - Test with complex documents and verify high-quality image extraction\n   - Verify table detection and formatting preservation\n   - Confirm that all formatting elements are properly maintained\n\n3. Create test cases for edge cases:\n   - Test with extremely large images to verify size limitations work\n   - Test with complex nested tables to verify maxComplexity settings\n   - Test with documents containing unusual formatting to verify preservation options\n\n4. Perform UI testing:\n   - Verify that the professional quality notice is displayed correctly\n   - Test that advanced settings panel (if retained) functions properly\n   - Ensure any customized settings are correctly passed to the conversion function\n\n5. Conduct performance testing:\n   - Measure conversion times for various document sizes and complexities\n   - Verify memory usage is optimized for large documents\n   - Identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize where possible\n\n6. Cross-browser testing:\n   - Verify functionality works consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge\n   - Ensure the professional quality messaging is displayed correctly across browsers",
