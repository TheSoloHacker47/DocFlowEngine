# Test Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PDF to Word Converter application.

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities. The goal is to ensure the application is high-quality, reliable, and meets user expectations.

## 2. Scope

This testing strategy covers the following aspects of the application:
- Core PDF to Word conversion functionality.
- User interface and user experience.
- Performance and responsiveness.
- Security.
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
- Accessibility.

## 3. Test Methodologies and Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing
- **Objective**: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Methodology**: Developers will write unit tests for all new code, aiming for a code coverage of at least 80%.

### 3.2. Integration Testing
- **Objective**: To test the interaction between different components of the application.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Methodology**: Integration tests will be written to verify that major components (e.g., file uploader, conversion engine, download button) work together as expected.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Objective**: To test the complete application flow from the user's perspective.
- **Tools**: Cypress.
- **Methodology**: E2E tests will simulate user scenarios, such as uploading a PDF, converting it, and downloading the Word document. These tests will be run in a headless browser as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3.4. Cross-Browser Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the application works correctly on different web browsers.
- **Tools**: BrowserStack or Sauce Labs (to be decided).
- **Methodology**: Manual and automated tests will be run on the latest versions of major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### 3.5. Accessibility Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities and compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Tools**: axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse.
- **Methodology**: Automated accessibility checks will be integrated into the E2E tests. Manual audits will also be performed using screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### 3.6. Performance Testing
- **Objective**: To ensure the application is fast and responsive.
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, Next.js Analytics.
- **Methodology**: Performance budgets will be set and monitored. Regular performance audits will be conducted to identify and fix bottlenecks.

### 3.7. Security Testing
- **Objective**: To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk.
- **Methodology**: Automated security scans will be run regularly. Manual penetration testing will be considered for major releases.

## 4. Test Environments
- **Development**: Local machines.
- **Testing/Staging**: A dedicated environment that mirrors production.
- **Production**: The live application.

## 5. CI/CD Integration
All automated tests (unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, security) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions). A build will fail if any tests fail, preventing buggy code from being deployed.

## 6. Running Tests Locally

### 6.1. Unit and Integration Tests
To run the unit and integration tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```

### 6.2. End-to-End Tests
To run the end-to-end tests, first make sure the application is running in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then, in a separate terminal, run the Cypress tests:
```bash
npx cypress run
```
To run the tests in a specific browser, use the `--browser` flag:
```bash
npx cypress run --browser chrome
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1. Cypress Tests Failing
- **Issue**: The component is not re-rendering after an action (e.g., file upload).
- **Solution**:
    1.  Add a `cy.wait()` to give the UI time to update.
    2.  Use `data-testid` attributes to ensure you are selecting the correct elements.
    3.  If the issue persists, it might be a deeper problem with the interaction between the UI library and Cypress.

## 8. Test Maintenance
- All new features must be accompanied by tests.
- Existing tests should be updated when the corresponding feature is modified.
- A regular review of the test suite should be conducted to remove obsolete tests and improve existing ones.
